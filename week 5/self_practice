*** Expirement 1:
I wondered what would happen when changing the lm code in slide 4 of the first part of the slides discussing the controls topic.
I changed lm in glm to check which the following code:
basefit_adjusted <- glm(log(sales) ~ log(price), data=oj)
The results are included as a seperate file in the folder for this week and these results are the same as the ones from the model with lm.
