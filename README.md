*** Expirement 1:
Changed the apply function (on slide 30) for learning about the class of variables.
I changed the '2' in the code in a '1'.
The code then becomes:
apply(data_self_testing_materials_week_1,1,class)
I learned that by changing the 2 in the code to a 1, you see the 'class' of 
each cell output instead of the 'class' for a variable.
