*** Expirement 1:
Changed the code of the first line of the second part on slide 22 for the first BH Algoritm example.
In the slides the first row of the code at the end of the slide is:
pval <- summary(spendy)$coef[-1, "Pr(>|t|)"]
I was interested in the use of the -1 in the code.
To learn what is does, I changed the -1 into -2: pval <- summary(spendy)$coef[-2, "Pr(>|t|)"].
When comparing the different outputs of p-values, I saw most of the output is identical, but the first specified 
p-value in the list is different from the one resulting from my code.
Also, the first presented p-value from the code including -1 is excluded in the list resulting from the code with -2 
and vice versa.
Therefore, I conclude the - followed by the number specifies which of the p-values to exclude from the list.
