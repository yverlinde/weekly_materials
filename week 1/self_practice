*** Expirement 1:
Changed the apply function (on slide 30) for learning about the class of variables.

First, I changed the '2' in the code in a '1'.
The code then becomes:
apply(CEO_Diary,1,class)
I learned that by changing the 2 in the code to a 1, you see the 'class' of 
each cell output instead of the 'class' for a variable.

After, I changed the '1' in the standard code into a '3' to investigate how this would alter the output.
Then the code is as follows: apply(CEO_Diary,3,class)
After running the code, I got an error R gives the following message: 'MARGIN' does not match dim(X)
So from this, I concluded the apply function could be run by using 

*** Expirement 2:
Changed the code summary(CEO_Diary[1:5]) on slide 31 to summary(CEO_Diary[1:2]).
I learned that the numbers within the code refer the column variables, since when changing the '5' to '2' I only see
the summary statisctics for the first 2 variables.
